                    <h2 class="story-title">Story</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">We met the old fashioned way: on the internet!</p>
                    <p class="story-text">After going on several dates in Boston from breakfast sandwiches to art
                        museums to movie night, it was clear we were a good fit :)</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title">Tidbits</h2>

                    <h3>Who made the first move? How?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">Will's opening line was, "that's a small moon" on a photo of Corey standing in
                        front of a large photorealistic moon globe. This moon was indeed small in comparison to the real
                        moon. Off to a good start!</p>
                    <h3>What was your first date?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text"><a href="#" id="nav-petsitting-puzzle">We spent the evening petsitting five
                            demanding animals. Each pet wanted a specific sandwich from Mike & Patty's, a crocheted
                            comfort item, a beloved plant buddo, and to watch their favorite season of Taskmaster.</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What was your most memorable date?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">On our third date, we went to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It was a
                        beautiful day and Will suggested that we try to make our way there without looking at google
                        maps, simply relying on memory and instinct.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">After a perfectly meandering walk and agreeing that stumbled-upon subway maps
                        were within the rules, we made it to the museum.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">While in the museum, Will quoted Corey's favorite Wallace & Gromit line to
                        her, much to her delight.</p>
                    <h3>What's your favorite activity together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">We love little adventures. We like climbing, album-listening walks, museums,
                        and art projects.</p>
                    <h3>What's the best meal you have eaten together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">So many! Here are three favorites:</p>
                    <p class="story-text">1. Sarma in Somerville for Will's birthday. Corey made the reservation exactly
                        one month earlier, as soon as the reservations opened. We ate Black Sea Cornbread, Pomegranate
                        Lamb Ribs, and some unforgettable tacos.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">2. Will makes a mean breakfast sandwich with all the fixin's and just a touch
                        of spicy honey.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">3. Corey's birthday dinner made by the 'rents in Providence. We had grilled
                        clams, lobster, potato salad, and more.</p>
                    <h3>What's the most memorable trip you have taken together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">After Corey spent two weeks in Brazil with her college roommate Christina,
                        Will met Corey at London Heathrow airport.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">We stayed with our friends John & Holly exploring London, before making our
                        way down to Brighton where Will proposed in front of the Seven Sisters white cliffs.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">We returned home after a two-day stopover in Iceland, driving (well, Will
                        drove) through hot spring-filled hills and black sand beaches.</p>
                    <h2 class="story-title">A Fun Fact From Will...</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">Your eyes convert light into brain tickles through a chemical reaction known
                        as 'photoisomerization' of a molecule called 'retinol'.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">Many zillions of retinol molecules live in protein cages in your eye cells
                        (rods and cones). They kind of look like loops of carbon atoms with a tail that has a kink in
                        it. As you look at and read these words, light is bombarding those molecules causing their tail
                        kinks to un-kink (photoisomerization). Once unkinked they wriggle out of their protein prisons,
                        which in turn causes those protein prisons to collapse, which then triggers a whole cascade
                        chain of biochemistry ultimately resulting in a little electrical tickle sent to your brain.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">Here is a video which visualizes the molecular unkinking: <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6v21W8zRIw">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
                    <p class="story-text">It is delightfully underwhelming.</p>
                    <h2 class="story-title">A Fun Fact From Corey...</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">The flamboyant cuttlefish is a small, brightly colored cephalopod. It grows up
                        to about 3 inches and has stunning purple, yellow, and white coloring. Cuttlefish change color
                        rapidly and dynamically through cells called chromatophores that expand and contract, resulting
                        in mesmerizing displays.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">In order to float, all cuttlefish have a porous "cuttlebone". Due to the small
                        size of the flamboyant cuttlefish cuttlebone, they can float only for a short time. Thus, they
                        tend to waddle along the sea floor. It is very cute.</p>

                            and to watch their favorite season of Taskmaster. If any demand is unmet, the pets will
                            unite and the kitchen cabinets will fall (again).
