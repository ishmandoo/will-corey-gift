                    <h2 class="story-title">Story</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">We met the old fashioned way: on the internet!</p>
                    <p class="story-text">After going on several dates in Boston from breakfast sandwiches to art museums to movie night, it was clear we were a good fit :)</p>
                    <h2 class="story-title">Tidbits</h2>
                    <h3>Who made the first move? How?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">Will's opening line was, "that's a small moon" on a photo of Corey standing in front of a large photorealistic moon globe. This moon was indeed small in comparison to the real moon. Off to a good start!</p>
                    <h3>What was your most memorable date?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">On our third date, we went to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It was a beautiful day and Will suggested that we try to make our way there without looking at google maps, simply relying on memory and instinct.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">After a perfectly meandering walk and agreeing that stumbled-upon subway maps were within the rules, we made it to the museum.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">While in the museum, Will quoted Corey's favorite Wallace & Gromit line to her, much to her delight.</p>
                    <h3>What's your favorite activity together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">We love little adventures. We like climbing, album-listening walks, museums, and art projects.</p>
                    <h3>What's the best meal you have eaten together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">So many! Here are three favorites:</p>
                    <p class="story-text">1. Sarma in Somerville for Will's birthday. Corey made the reservation exactly one month earlier, as soon as the reservations opened. We ate Black Sea Cornbread, Pomegranate Lamb Ribs, and some unforgettable tacos.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">2. Will makes a mean breakfast sandwich with all the fixin's and just a touch of spicy honey.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">3. Corey's birthday dinner made by the 'rents in Providence. We had grilled clams, lobster, potato salad, and more.</p>
                    <h3>What's the most memorable trip you have taken together?</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">After Corey spent two weeks in Brazil with her college roommate Christina, Will met Corey at London Heathrow airport.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">We stayed with our friends John & Holly exploring London, before making our way down to Brighton where Will proposed in front of the Seven Sisters white cliffs.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">We returned home after a two-day stopover in Iceland, driving (well, Will drove) through hot spring-filled hills and black sand beaches.</p>
                    <h2 class="story-title">A Fun Fact From Will...</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">Your eyes convert light into brain tickles through a chemical reaction known as 'photoisomerization' of a molecule called 'retinol'.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">Many zillions of retinol molecules live in protein cages in your eye cells (rods and cones). They kind of look like loops of carbon atoms with a tail that has a kink in it. As you look at and read these words, light is bombarding those molecules causing their tail kinks to un-kink (photoisomerization). Once unkinked they wriggle out of their protein prisons, which in turn causes those protein prisons to collapse, which then triggers a whole cascade chain of biochemistry ultimately resulting in a little electrical tickle sent to your brain.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">Here is a video which visualizes the molecular unkinking: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6v21W8zRIw">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
                    <p class="story-text">It is delightfully underwhelming.</p>
                    <h2 class="story-title">A Fun Fact From Corey...</h2>
                    <p class="story-text">The flamboyant cuttlefish is a small, brightly colored cephalopod. It grows up to about 3 inches and has stunning purple, yellow, and white coloring. Cuttlefish change color rapidly and dynamically through cells called chromatophores that expand and contract, resulting in mesmerizing displays.</p>
                    <p class="story-text">In order to float, all cuttlefish have a porous "cuttlebone". Due to the small size of the flamboyant cuttlefish cuttlebone, they can float only for a short time. Thus, they tend to waddle along the sea floor. It is very cute.</p>
